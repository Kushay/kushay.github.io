# Residential Ethernet Infrastructure Re-Termination & Optimization
When I moved into my home, I realized that when I plugged in the cat5e cable into my pc from the wall port, I didn't receive any connectivity. The technician had came in and set up the wifi and "supposedly" got the wall port working too. The wifi was working fine so I concluded it was the ethernet port on the wall that was the problem, probably the connectivity from the router. When I opened the panel in which our technician installed the router, I saw that the ethernet connection ran from the router -> cat 5e cable -> connected to another cat 5e cable feeding into the wall connected by a gel filled cable splicer (I had to look this up).
