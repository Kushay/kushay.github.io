# Residential Ethernet Infrastructure Re-Termination & Optimization
When I moved into my home, I realized that when I plugged in the cat5e cable into my pc from the wall port, I didn't receive any connectivity. The technician had came in and set up the wifi and "supposedly" got the wall port working too. The wifi was working fine so I concluded it was the ethernet port on the wall that was the problem, probably the connectivity from the router. When I opened the panel in which our technician installed the router, I saw that the ethernet connection ran from the router -> white/black cat 5e cable -> connected to the blue cat 5e cable feeding into the wall connected by a gel filled cable splicer (I had to look this up).

After research, I saw that this type of connection can result in efficiency of the cables, so I decided to buy a crimper kit myself to directly feed the cat5e cables into the router to optimize efficiency and for a cleaner look in the patch panel. I started off by cutting this mess of a connection off with the wire cutter that came with the kit. Then I had to strip the cable from the protective wiring to make room to crimp the cables to a rj45 plug. Looking at the cables, I was able to determine that the cables used the T-568B standard where it starts with the orange wires first. So I untwisted the cable pairs and straightened them out to arrange them into the correct order.
